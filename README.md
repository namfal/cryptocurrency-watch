# Crypto Watch

A simple project to watch crypto value in real time and related news.

Before you run this locally, you need to obtain your own API key from [NewsAPI](https://newsapi.org) and put it in the `.env` file:

`REACT_APP_NEWS_API= YOUR API KEY`

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
